## What is Schorle?

Schorle is a framework for building elegant and efficient applications in Python and JS/TSX. It bridges the gap between Python backend development and modern frontend user interfaces, enabling developers to build full-stack applications using Python for business logic while leveraging React/TypeScript for UI components.

## Why Schorle?

Modern Python development misses a lot of the frontend development experience. Practically, developers have several options:

1. **Use server-side rendering** and produce static HTML files (e.g. in FastAPI / Flask + Jinja2)
2. **Use server-side websocket-connected frameworks** (e.g. Streamlit / Dash / Reflex.dev)
3. **Have two separate codebases** for frontend and backend (e.g. FastAPI + React / Next.js)
4. **Refrain from using Python completely** and use pure JS-based server and frontend (e.g. NextJS)

Unfortunately, none of these options are ideal for various reasons.

The idea of Schorle is to provide developers with a single, pythonic backend and readymade frontend integrations, while preserving flexibility and avoiding complexity of frontend setup.

## Frontend Technologies

Schorle uses the following technologies for the frontend:

- **[React](https://react.dev/)** - Component-based UI library for building interactive interfaces
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling
- **[Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** - High-quality, accessible component library

To simplify the pages and components development. However, users don't need to setup, compile and configure the frontend infrastructure - it's provided by Schorle with zero configuration.

## Why Schorle Over Alternatives?

Let's compare schorle with other options:

### vs. Pythonic Frontend Frameworks (Dash / Streamlit / Reflex.dev)

**JSX Advantages:**

- JSX is a great way to write frontend code. It's a simple, declarative way to describe the UI
- Modern AI agents are very good at writing JSX code
- JSX-based frontend provides full flexibility and control over the frontend behavior

**Scaling Issues:**

- Pythonic frontend frameworks require a separate websocket connection for each opened page, which scales poorly
- Schorle uses stateless HTTP-based rendering for better scaling

**UI Flexibility:**

- Limited UI flexibility compared to modern React patterns
- Smaller component ecosystem compared to React
- AI code generation works better with JSX than Python UI DSLs

### vs. Server-side Rendering Frameworks (FastAPI / Flask + Jinja2 / HTMX)

**Component Limitations:**

- Server-side rendering frameworks are great for static pages
- However, they are not very good for dynamic pages, especially with rich UI components
- Template-based rendering lacks component reusability
- Limited interactivity without significant JavaScript

**Schorle Advantages:**

- Component-based architecture with full reusability
- Rich client-side interactivity while maintaining Python backend
- Type-safe data flow and automatic API generation

### vs. Pure JS Frameworks (NextJS / Remix)

**Setup Complexity:**

- Pure JS frameworks are great, but they require a lot of setup and configuration
- Backend codebase needs to be written in JS/TS
- Python developers must learn Node.js ecosystem
- Loss of Python's data science/ML libraries
- Separate deployment and scaling considerations

**Schorle Advantages:**

- Keep Python for backend logic, data processing, ML integration
- Unified deployment model
- Leverage existing Python expertise and libraries
- Zero frontend configuration required

## Typical Schorle Application Structure

Assume we have a project called `charming_aurora` with the following structure:

<Files>
  <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="charming_aurora" defaultOpen>
      <File name="app.py" />
      <File name="models.py" />
      <Folder name="ui" defaultOpen>
        <File name="index.css" />
        <Folder name="components" defaultOpen>
          <File name="button.tsx" />
        </Folder>
        <Folder name="pages" defaultOpen>
          <File name="Index.tsx" />
          <File name="About.tsx" />
        </Folder>
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
  <File name="bun.lock" />
  <File name="pyproject.toml" />
  <File name="README.md" />
  <File name="uv.lock" />
</Files>

The `app.py` file contains:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from charming_aurora.ui import Index, About

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return Index()

@app.get("/about")
def read_about():
    return About()
```

Schorle takes care of automatically compiling the frontend code and serving it on the backend, providing a unified development experience that combines the best of both Python and modern frontend development.
